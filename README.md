# Restaurant Compliance, Prototype

[Demo Video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9v7631ucdgufgc9/complianceApp.mov?dl=0)

## What?

A prototype for managing and overseeing regular (daily) close-down requirements at a restaurant. The primary UI is:

-   Lists of tasks…
-   Organised by category.

Each task has:

-   UI to mark a task as complete or blocked;
-   Further information for that task (as subtasks).

A simple permission layer gives management / the duty-manager further UI views and options:

-   To sign-off a task done by a non-manager (for legal compliance reasons);
-   To add comments to each task (for further actions and reports);
-   To send incorrectly / unfinished tasks back to the initial list for non-managers.

## Post-prototype / Future Requirements

-   Content management layer
    -   Adding / removing / renaming tasks
    -   Permissioning
-   Reporting
    -   Daily email summary for compliance requirements
